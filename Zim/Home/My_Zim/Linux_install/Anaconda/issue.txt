CommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda activate'.
To initialize your shell, run
	$ conda init <SHELL_NAME>
Currently supported shells are:
  - bash
  - fish
  - tcsh
  - xonsh
  - zsh
  - powershell
See 'conda init --help' for more information and options.
IMPORTANT: You may need to close and restart your shell after running 'conda init'.

```
As of fish 2.6.0 conda 4.3.27: the following steps may change as issue is addressed

update config
Take note of your conda's location

conda info --root
/Users/mstreeter/anaconda    # this is my <PATH_TO_ROOT>
Add line to ~/.config/fish/config.fish

 source <PATH_TO_ROOT>/etc/fish/conf.d/conda.fish
update convention
Typically you'd run the following from bash

source activate <environment>
source deactivate <environment>
Now you must run the following from fish

conda activate <environment>
__conda deactivate <environment>__
issues
so after doing this I'm not able to set fish as my default shell and have it still work properly with conda. Currently, I must first enter my default shell, and enter fish and the shell works as expected. I'll update this after I find out how to get it working completely without the need to explicitly choose fish each time I log into my terminal
```
