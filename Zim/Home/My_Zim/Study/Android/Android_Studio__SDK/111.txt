we have detected that your system can run the Android emulator in an accelerated perfomance mode.
Linux-based system support virtual machine acceleration through th KVM(Kernel-mod Virtual Machine) software package.
Search fo install instructions for your particular Linux configuration [Android KVM Linux Installation](https://developer.android.com/r/studio-ui/emulator-kvm-setup.html) that KVM is enabled for faster Android emulator performance.

#####################KVM
Configure VM acceleration on Linux

Linux-based systems support VM acceleration through the KVM software package. Follow the instructions for installing KVM on your Linux system, and verify that KVM is enabled. For Ubuntu systems, see Ubuntu KVM Installation.
Requirements

Running KVM requires specific user permissions. Make sure that you have sufficient permissions as specified in the KVM installation instructions.

To use VM acceleration on Linux, your computer must also meet these requirements:

	For Intel processors: Support for Virtualization Technology (VT-x), Intel EM64T (Intel 64) features, and Execute Disable (XD) Bit functionality enabled.
	For AMD processors: Support for AMD Virtualization (AMD-V).

Check whether KVM is currently installed on Linux

You can use the emulator -accel-check command-line option to check whether you have KVM installed. Alternatively, you can install the cpu-checker package containing the kvm-ok command.

The following example shows how to use the kvm-ok command:

$ sudo apt-get install cpu-checker
$ egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
12
$ kvm-ok
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used

Install KVM on Linux

Use the following command to install KVM:

sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin ubuntu-vm-builder bridge-utils ia32-libs-multiarch
