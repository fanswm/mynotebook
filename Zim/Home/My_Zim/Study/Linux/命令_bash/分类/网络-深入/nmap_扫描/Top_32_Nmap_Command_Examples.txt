Top 32 Nmap Command Examples For Linux Sys/Network Admins
Author: Vivek Gite Last updated: May 7, 2020 25 comments
Nmap is short for Network Mapper. It is an open-source security tool for network exploration, security scanning, and auditing. However, the Nmap command comes with lots of options that can make the utility more robust and difficult to follow for new users. The purpose of this guide is to introduce a user to the Nmap command line tool to scan a host or network to find out the possible vulnerable points in the hosts. You will also learn how to use Nmap for offensive and defensive purposes. Let us see some common Nmap command examples running on Linux or Unix-like systems.

ADVERTISEMENTS

What is Nmap and what is it used for?

Top 32 Nmap Command Examples For Linux Sys/Network Admins
nmap in action

From the man page:
Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

It was originally written by Gordon Lyon and it can answer the following questions easily:

Find running computers on the local network
What IP addresses did you find running on the local network?
Discover the operating system of your target machine
Find out what ports are open on the machine that you just scanned?
See if the system is infected with malware or virus.
Search for unauthorized servers or network service on your network.
Locate and remove computers which don’t meet the organization’s minimum level of security.
Nmap Command Examples in Linux and Unix – Sample setup (LAB) for
Port scanning may be illegal in some jurisdictions. So setup a lab as follows:

							  +---------+
		+---------+           | Network |         +--------+
		| server1 |-----------+ swtich  +---------|server2 |
		+---------+           | (sw0)   |         +--------+
							  +----+----+
								   | 
								   |
						 +---------+----------------+
						 | wks01 Linux/macOS/Win    |
						 +--------------------------+
Where,

wks01 is your computer either running Linux/macOS (OS X) or Unix like operating system. It is used for scanning your local network. The nmap command must be installed on this computer.
server1 can be powered by Linux / Unix / MS-Windows operating systems. This is an unpatched server. Feel free to install a few services such as a web-server, file server and so on.
server2 can be powered by Linux / Unix / MS-Windows operating systems. This is a fully patched server with firewall. Again, feel free to install few services such as a web-server, file server and so on.
All three systems are connected via switch.
How do I install nmap on Linux?
See:

Debian / Ubuntu Linux: Install nmap Software For Scanning Network
CentOS / RHEL: Install nmap Network Security Scanner
OpenBSD: Install nmap Network Security Scanner
1. Scan a single host or an IP address (IPv4) using nmap
### Scan a single ip address ###
nmap 192.168.1.1
 
## Scan a host name ###
nmap server1.cyberciti.biz
 
## Scan a host name with more info###
nmap -v server1.cyberciti.biz

Fig.01: nmap output
Fig.01: nmap output

2. Scan multiple IP address or subnet (IPv4)
nmap 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3
## works with same subnet i.e. 192.168.1.0/24 
nmap 192.168.1.1,2,3
You can scan a range of IP address too:

nmap 192.168.1.1-20
You can scan a range of IP address using a wildcard:

nmap 192.168.1.*
Finally, you scan an entire subnet:

nmap 192.168.1.0/24
3. Read list of hosts/networks from a file (IPv4)
The -iL option allows you to read the list of target systems using a text file. This is useful to scan a large number of hosts/networks. Create a text file as follows:
cat > /tmp/test.txt

Append names as follows:

server1.cyberciti.biz
192.168.1.0/24
192.168.1.1/24
10.1.2.3
localhost
The syntax is as follows:

nmap -iL /tmp/test.txt
4. Excluding hosts/networks (IPv4) from nmap scan examples
When scanning a large number of hosts/networks you can exclude hosts from a scan:

nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.5
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.5,192.168.1.254
OR exclude list from a file called /tmp/exclude.txt

nmap -iL /tmp/scanlist.txt --excludefile /tmp/exclude.txt
5. Turn on OS and version detection scanning script (IPv4) with nmap
nmap -A 192.168.1.254
nmap -v -A 192.168.1.1
nmap -A -iL /tmp/scanlist.txt 
6. Find out if a host/network is protected by a firewall using namp command
## nmap command examples for your host ##
nmap -sA 192.168.1.254
nmap -sA server1.cyberciti.biz
7. Scan a host when protected by the firewall
In this Nmap command examples we are going to scan a router/wifi device having 192.168.1.1 as IP:

nmap -PN 192.168.1.1
nmap -PN server1.cyberciti.biz
8. Scan an IPv6 host/address examples
The -6 option enable IPv6 scanning with the namp command. The syntax is:

nmap -6 IPv6-Address-Here
nmap -6 server1.cyberciti.biz
nmap -6 2607:f0d0:1002:51::4
nmap -v A -6 2607:f0d0:1002:51::4
9. Scan a network and find out which servers and devices are up and running
This is known as host discovery or ping scan:

nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
Here is how it looks:

Host 192.168.1.1 is up (0.00035s latency).
MAC Address: BC:AE:C5:C3:16:93 (Unknown)
Host 192.168.1.2 is up (0.0038s latency).
MAC Address: 74:44:01:40:57:FB (Unknown)
Host 192.168.1.5 is up.
Host nas03 (192.168.1.12) is up (0.0091s latency).
MAC Address: 00:11:32:11:15:FC (Synology Incorporated)
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 2.80 second
10. How do I perform a fast scan using the namp?
nmap -F 192.168.1.1
nmap -6 -F IPv6_Address_Here

18. How do I detect remote services (server / daemon) version numbers?
Open the terminal and then type the following nmap command:

nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
Sample outputs:

Starting Nmap 5.00 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2012-11-27 01:34 IST
Interesting ports on 192.168.1.1:
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     Dropbear sshd 0.52 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http?
1 service unrecognized despite returning data.
19. Scan a host using TCP ACK (PA) and TCP Syn (PS) ping
If firewall is blocking standard ICMP pings, try the following host discovery methods:

nmap -PS 192.168.1.1
nmap -PS 80,21,443 192.168.1.1
nmap -PA 192.168.1.1
nmap -PA 80,21,200-512 192.168.1.1
20. Scan a host using IP protocol ping
nmap -PO 192.168.1.1
21. Scan a host using UDP ping
This scan bypasses firewalls and filters that only screen TCP:

nmap -PU 192.168.1.1
nmap -PU 2000.2001 192.168.1.1
22. Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using TCP SYN Scan
### Stealthy scan ###
nmap -sS 192.168.1.1
 
### Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using  TCP connect scan (warning: no stealth scan)
###  OS Fingerprinting ###
nmap -sT 192.168.1.1
 
### Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using TCP ACK scan
nmap -sA 192.168.1.1
 
### Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using TCP Window scan
nmap -sW 192.168.1.1
 
### Find out the most commonly used TCP ports using TCP Maimon scan
nmap -sM 192.168.1.1
23. Scan a host for UDP services (UDP scan)
Most popular services on the Internet run over the TCP protocol. DNS, SNMP, and DHCP are three of the most common UDP services. Use the following syntax to find out UDP services:

nmap -sU nas03
nmap -sU 192.168.1.1
Sample outputs:

Starting Nmap 5.00 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2012-11-27 00:52 IST

MAC Address: 00:11:32:11:15:FC (Synology Incorporated)
 
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1099.55 seconds
24. Scan for IP protocol
This type of scan allows you to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by target machines:

nmap -sO 192.168.1.1
25. Scan a firewall for security weakness
The following scan types exploit a subtle loophole in the TCP and good for testing security of common attacks:

## TCP Null Scan to fool a firewall to generate a response ##
## Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0) ##
nmap -sN 192.168.1.254
 
## TCP Fin scan to check firewall ##
## Sets just the TCP FIN bit ##
nmap -sF 192.168.1.254
 
## TCP Xmas scan to check firewall ##
## Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree ##
nmap -sX 192.168.1.254
See how to block Xmas packkets, syn-floods and other conman attacks with iptables.

26. Scan a firewall for packets fragments
The -f option causes the requested scan (including ping scans) to use tiny fragmented IP packets. The idea is to split up the TCP header over
several packets to make it harder for packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and other annoyances to detect what you are doing.

nmap -f 192.168.1.1
nmap -f fw2.nixcraft.net.in
nmap -f 15 fw2.nixcraft.net.in

## Set your own offset size with the --mtu option ##
nmap --mtu 32 192.168.1.1
27. Cloak a scan with decoys
The -D option it appear to the remote host that the host(s) you specify as decoys are scanning the target network too. Thus their IDS might report 5-10 port scans from unique IP addresses, but they won’t know which IP was scanning them and which were innocent decoys:

nmap -n -Ddecoy-ip1,decoy-ip2,your-own-ip,decoy-ip3,decoy-ip4 remote-host-ip
nmap -n -D192.168.1.5,10.5.1.2,172.1.2.4,3.4.2.1 192.168.1.5
28. Scan a firewall for MAC address spoofing
### Spoof your MAC address ##
nmap --spoof-mac MAC-ADDRESS-HERE 192.168.1.1
 
### Add other options ###
nmap -v -sT -PN --spoof-mac MAC-ADDRESS-HERE 192.168.1.1
 
 
### Use a random MAC address ###
### The number 0, means nmap chooses a completely random MAC address ###
nmap -v -sT -PN --spoof-mac 0 192.168.1.1
29. How do I save output to a text file?
The syntax is:

nmap 192.168.1.1 > output.txt
nmap -oN /path/to/filename 192.168.1.1
nmap -oN output.txt 192.168.1.1
30. Scans for web servers and pipes into Nikto for scanning
nmap -p80 192.168.1.2/24 -oG - | /path/to/nikto.pl -h -
nmap -p80,443 192.168.1.2/24 -oG - | /path/to/nikto.pl -h -

31. Speed up nmap
Pass the -T option to the nmap command:
nmap -v -sS -A -T4 192.168.2.5

32. Not a fan of namp command line tools?
So far, we have seen Nmap command examples using the Linux and Unix command-line options. However, not everyone is super comfortable with the CLI. Hence, we can use the GUI app named Zenmap, which is the official network mapper front end/GUI tool:

Zenmap is the official Nmap Security Scanner GUI. It is a multi-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, BSD, etc.) free and open source application which aims to make Nmap easy for beginners to use while providing advanced features for experienced Nmap users. Frequently used scans can be saved as profiles to make them easy to run repeatedly. A command creator allows interactive creation of Nmap command lines. Scan results can be saved and viewed later. Saved scan results can be compared with one another to see how they differ. The results of recent scans are stored in a searchable database.

You can install zenmap using the following apt-get command or apt command:
$ sudo apt-get install zenmap
