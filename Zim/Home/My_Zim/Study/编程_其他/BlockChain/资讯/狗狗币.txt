To Build
```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install # optional
```

This will build Dogecoin-Qt as well if the dependencies are met.

Dependencies for the GUI: Ubuntu & Debian
If you want to build Dogecoin-Qt, make sure that the required packages for Qt development are installed. Either Qt 4 or Qt 5 are necessary to build the GUI. If both Qt 4 and Qt 5 are installed, Qt 4 will be used. Pass --with-gui=qt5 to configure to choose Qt5. To build without GUI pass --without-gui.

To build with Qt 4, you need the following:

sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
For Qt 5, you need the following:

sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
libqrencode (optional) can be installed with:

sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev
Once these are installed, they will be found by configure and a dogecoin-qt executable will be built by default.
