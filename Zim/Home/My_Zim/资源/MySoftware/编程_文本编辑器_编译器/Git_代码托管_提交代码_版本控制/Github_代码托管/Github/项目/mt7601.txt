Usage
First install kernel-devel for your Linux distro

git clone https://github.com/porjo/mt7601.git
cd mt7601/src
make
mkdir -p /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
cp RT2870STA.dat /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
insmod os/linux/mt7601Usta.ko
If the module has loaded OK, you should see mt7601Usta listed in the output of lsmod and a new network interface ra0 should be present in the output of ip link.

If all goes well, you can permanently install the driver with make install.
