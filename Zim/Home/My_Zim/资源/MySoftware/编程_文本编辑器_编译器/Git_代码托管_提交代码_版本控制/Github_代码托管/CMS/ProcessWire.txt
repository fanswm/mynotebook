Requirements
A server running Ubuntu 18.04..
A non-root user with sudo privileges.
Getting Started
Before starting, you will need to update your system with the latest version. You can do this by running the following command:
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
Once your system is updated, restart the system to apply the changes.
Install Apache, MariaDB and PHP
First, you will need to install Apache web server, MariaDB server, PHP and other PHP modules to your server. You can install all the packages by just running the following command:
sudo apt-get install apache2 mariadb-server unzip wget php7.2 php7.2-mysql php7.2-curl php7.2-json php7.2-cgi libapache2-mod-php7.2 php7.2-xmlrpc php7.2-gd php7.2-mbstring php7.2 php7.2-common php7.2-xmlrpc php7.2-soap php7.2-xml php7.2-intl php7.2-cli php7.2-ldap php7.2-zip php7.2-readline php7.2-imap php7.2-tidy php7.2-recode php7.2-sq php7.2-intl -y
Once all the packages are installed, open php.ini file and make some changes:
sudo nano /etc/php/7.2/apache2/php.ini
Make the following changes:
memory_limit = 300M
upload_max_filesize = 200M
max_execution_time = 400
date.timezone = Asia/Kolkata
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl restart mariadb
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
You can now check the status of MariaDB service with the following command:
sudo systemctl status mariadb
Output:
? mariadb.service - MariaDB 10.1.34 database server
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

Configure MariaDB
By default, MariaDB installation is not secured. So, you will need to secure it first. You can secure it by running the following command:
sudo mysql_secure_installation
Answer all the questions as shown below:
    Enter current password for root (enter for none):
    Set root password? [Y/n]: N
    Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]: Y
    Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]: Y
    Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]:  Y
    Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]:  Y
Once the MariaDB is secured, log in to MariaDB shell:
mysql -u root -p
Provide your root password. Then, create a database and user for ProcessWire with the following command:
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE processdb;
MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE USER process;
Next, grant privileges to the ProcessWire database with the following command:
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON processdb.* TO 'process'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Next, flush the privileges with the following command:
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Next, exit from the MariaDB console with the following command:
MariaDB [(none)]> exit
Download and Install ProcessWire
You can download the latest version of ProcessWire from Git repository using the following command:
wget https://github.com/processwire/processwire/archive/master.zip
After downloading, unzip the downloaded file with the following command:
unzip master.zip
Next, copy the extracted directory to the Apache web root directory with the following command:
sudo cp -r processwire-master /var/www/html/processwire
Next, give proper permissions to the processwire directory with the following command:
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/processwire/
sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html/processwire/
Configure Apache for ProcessWire
Next, you will need to create an Apache virtual host file for ProcessWire. You can do this by running the following command:
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/processwire.conf
Add the following lines:
<VirtualHost *:80>
     ServerAdmin admin@example.com
     DocumentRoot /var/www/html/processwire
     ServerName example.com

     <Directory /var/www/html/processwire/>
          Options +FollowSymlinks
          AllowOverride All
          Require all granted
     </Directory>

     ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/processwire_error.log
     CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/processwire_access.log combined

</VirtualHost>
Save and close the file, when you are finished. Then, enable Apache virtual host file and rewrite module with the following command:
sudo a2ensite processwire.conf
sudo a2enmod rewrite
Finally, restart Apache service to apply all the changes:
sudo systemctl restart apache2
