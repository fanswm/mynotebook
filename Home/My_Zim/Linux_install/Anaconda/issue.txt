CommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda activate'.
To initialize your shell, run
	$ conda init <SHELL_NAME>
Currently supported shells are:
  - bash
  - fish
  - tcsh
  - xonsh
  - zsh
  - powershell
See 'conda init --help' for more information and options.
IMPORTANT: You may need to close and restart your shell after running 'conda init'.

```
As of fish 2.6.0 conda 4.3.27: the following steps may change as issue is addressed

update config
Take note of your conda's location

conda info --root
/Users/mstreeter/anaconda    # this is my <PATH_TO_ROOT>
Add line to ~/.config/fish/config.fish

 source <PATH_TO_ROOT>/etc/fish/conf.d/conda.fish
update convention
Typically you'd run the following from bash

source activate <environment>
source deactivate <environment>
Now you must run the following from fish

conda activate <environment>
__conda deactivate <environment>__
issues
so after doing this I'm not able to set fish as my default shell and have it still work properly with conda. Currently, I must first enter my default shell, and enter fish and the shell works as expected. I'll update this after I find out how to get it working completely without the need to explicitly choose fish each time I log into my terminal

The new messaging around inconsistent environment is being shown as of conda 4.6.9 (see #8444). Prior to this release there was no messaging shown when conda encountered an inconsistent environment unless verbosity was turned up. It is likely that these environment were inconsistent prior to updating conda, the new release just made this visible.
The best method to restore consistency to the environment is conda install the package listed as inconsistent. Review the package plan during this process to make sure nothing inappropiate is being installed. It may be necessary to use conda remove to remote troublesome packages in this process.

We hope to add tools that will make understanding and resolving inconsistent environment more straightforward and simple in the near future.
